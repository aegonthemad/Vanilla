 * Extension of the PhysicsComponent to put bounds on velocity.
 * <p/>
 * Basically, the official protocol handles it like this...
 * - Motion is in block units, each tick at 1/32000
 * - Velocity is clamped at a min of -0.9 and a max of 0.9 blocks per tick
 * - Protocol velocity values are simply multiplying blocks by the max block units. This leaves
 * a maximum of 28800 per axis per tick for protocol motion.
