License
-------
Vanilla is licensed under the [GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3][License], but with a provision that files are released under the MIT license 180 days after they are published. Please see the `LICENSE.txt` file for details.

Compiling
---------
Vanilla uses Maven to handle its dependencies.

* Install [Maven 2 or 3](http://maven.apache.org/download.html)  
* Checkout this repo and run: `mvn clean install`

Using with Your Project
-----------------------
For those using [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.html) to manage project dependencies, simply include the following in your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.spout</groupId>
        <artifactId>vanilla</artifactId>
        <version>1.2.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

If you do not already have repo.spout.org in your repository list, you will need to add this also:

    <repository>
        <id>spout-repo</id>
        <url>https://repo.spout.org</url>
    </repository>

Coding and Pull Request Formatting
----------------------------------
* Generally follow the Oracle coding standards.
* Use tabs, no spaces.
* No trailing whitespaces.
* 200 column limit for readability.
* All new files must include the license header. This can be done automatically with Maven by running mvn clean.
* All changes made via pull requests first be compiled locally to verify that the code does indeed compile, and tested to verify that it actually works.
* Where practical, a test should be included to verify the change. Except in exceptional cases, bug fixes **MUST** include a test case which fails for the current version and passes for the updated version.
* Commit messages must include:
    - A brief description of the change
    - A more detailed description of the change (second line and below, optional)
    - Sign-off, verifying agreement with the license terms
* Number of commits in a pull request should be kept to **one commit** and all additional commits must be **squashed** except for circumstantial exceptions.
* You may have more than one commit in a pull request if the commits are separate changes, otherwise squash the commits.
* For clarification, see the full pull request guidelines [here](http://spout.in/prguide).

**Please follow the above conventions if you want your pull request(s) accepted.**
